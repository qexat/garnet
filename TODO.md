Things that kinda go together:

 * Implement usize and unsigned types
 * Start thinking about generics
 * Implement arrays (not slices, yet)
 * Make loops

 * Implement structs
 * Make tuple<->struct conversions
 * Figure out type conversions in general -- including between integer
   types
 * Start thinking about generics
 * Start thinking about methods

 * Implement enums
 * Implement sum types
 * Make struct+enum <-> sum type conversions
 * Basic pattern matching

 * Start working on move semantics
 * Start working on pointers/references
 * Start working on borrow checker
 * Start thinking about properties
