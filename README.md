# Garnet

An experiment in a systems programming language along the lines of Rust
but more minimal.  Where Rust is a C++ that doesn't suck, it'd be nice
for this to be a C that doesn't suck.

Loosely based on <https://wiki.alopex.li/BetterThanC>, far more loosely
based on <https://wiki.alopex.li/GarnetLanguage> which has a different
compiler entirely.
