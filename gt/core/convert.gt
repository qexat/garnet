--- Conversion modules/interfaces.
--- 
--- Design ticket for stuff here:
--- from/tryfrom
--- try (? operator)


--- Infallible conversions
type From(Self, Out) = struct(Self, Out) =
  from: fn(Self) Out
end

--- Fallible conversions
type TryFrom(Self, Out, E) = struct(Self, Out) =
  try_from: fn(Self) Result(Out, E)
end
