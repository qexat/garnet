I recall people once talking about a misdesign with Rust's iterators and Range, does anyone recall what the heck it was?

Ranges implement Iterator directly
Means they can't be Copy, which is really annoying

I think-- right, that was it
Thanks
Why can't Iterator's be Copy though, then?

it results in unexpected behavior (hopefully someone has an example)
